## About

Sacrifices some of the Paladin's health to instantly heal an ally for a heavy amount. The Paladin takes damage equal to half the amount of the healing done. [Light of the Martyr](./LightOfTheMartyr.md) isn't replicated by [Beacon of Light](./BeaconOfLight.md) and can't be cast on the Paladin.
