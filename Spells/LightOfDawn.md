## About

Heals up to 5 injured allies in a frontal cone for a medium amount of health.

Light of Dawn is **not** a [smart heal](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Smart_spell). It picks up to 5 injured allies at random, regardless of the health they're missing. If there are fewer than 5 injured players, it will randomly select full health players.

Your positioning and aim is important when casting Light of Dawn. Sticking with melee is usually an easy way to be in range of 5 injured players.

### Targeting

There is a 360 degree radius of 5 yards around the player in addition to the 90 degree cone of 15 yards in front of the player. Both are increased by 50% by [Rule of Law](Talents/30/RuleOfLaw.md).

As long as any part of a player's hitbox is inside the radius, they're eligible for a heal.

The area where players need to be in order to be eligible for a heal is illustrated in the image below.

Pets can also be targeted and will count towards the max players healed.
