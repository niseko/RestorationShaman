## About

Casting [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) on a target applies Judgment of Light with 25 stacks. Each stack heals injured allies attacking the target for a small amount of healing.

- Can be applied to multiple targets (multidotting)
- Multiple Paladins can apply Judgment of Light at the same time
- Full health players do **not** consume any stacks. This leads to low overhealing.
- Auto-attacks, physical abilities and magical spells all consume a stack.
