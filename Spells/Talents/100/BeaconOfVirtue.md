## About

Due to its high mana cost this is rarely seen in raids.

Beacon of Virtue is **not** a [smart heal](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Smart_spell). It picks your target and up to 3 injured allies at random, regardless of the health they're missing. If there are fewer than 3 injured players, it will randomly select full health players.

## Bugs

- Beacon of Virtue transfers at twice the normal efficiency #4
