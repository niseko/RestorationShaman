## About

Provides you with a new spell to place an extra beacon on another target that acts the same as [Beacon of Light](../../BeaconOfLight.md). Both beacons heal 30% less: Your heals will transfer 28% instead of 40% of the raw healing done.

The default healing done per spell with beacon transfer accounted for is 100% (from the heal) + 40% beacon transfer = 140%. With Beacon of Faith this becomes 100% + 28% + 28% = 156% (11% more).

A bonus is that BoF allows you to not worry about beacon swapping during the fight, and you don't have to spend any GCDs on swapping beacon targets.

See also [Beacon of Light](../../BeaconOfLight.md).
