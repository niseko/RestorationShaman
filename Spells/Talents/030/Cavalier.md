## About

Gives Divine Steed one more charge, increasing the max possible casts per fight by 1.

### Raiding

This is usually a poor choice for raid content. It may be taken on very high movement fights, but even then you might prefer [Rule of Law](./RuleOfLaw.md) to be able to reach everyone with increased mastery effectiveness.

### Dungeons

This is the recommended talent for dungeons, allowing you to stick with your group more easily, quickly move out of mechanics and since the other talents are less useful in dungeons.
