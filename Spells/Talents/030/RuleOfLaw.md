Increases the range of your heals and [Mastery](/Mastery.md) by 50% for 10 seconds.

By default your Mastery is 100% effective up to 10 yards away, then linearly decays to 0% at 40 yards. With Rule of Law active this changes to 100% effectiveness up to 15 yards, and decaying to 0% at 60 yards. See [Mastery](/Mastery.md) for more information.
