## About

Reduces the cooldown of [Divine Shield](../../DivineShield.md), [Divine Protection](../../DivineProtection.md), and [Lay on Hands](../../LayOnHands.md).

Might be taken in both raids and dungeons if you need the increased survivability.

Could be used with [Aura of Sacrifice](../60/AuraOfSacrifice.md) to be able to pair [Aura Mastery](../../AuraMastery.md) with [Divine Shield](../../DivineShield.md) every 3.5 minutes to increase its reliability. See the [Aura of Sacrifice](../60/AuraOfSacrifice.md) page for more information.
